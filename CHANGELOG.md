[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-19

First feature-complete version — everything from the v1 specification.

### Added

- **Panel connection & dashboard** — connect a Pterodactyl panel with a
  client API key (stored in the OS keychain, never in plain text) and see
  all servers as tiles with live status, CPU and RAM.
- **Live servers** — power actions (start/stop/restart, two-step kill),
  streamed console with command input, live stats over the Wings websocket
  with automatic token refresh and reconnect.
- **One-click deploys** — link a local project folder to a server and ship
  it: zip → upload via the panel's signed URL → extract, with
  `.deployignore` (gitignore syntax), configurable target directory,
  post-deploy restart or desktop notification, and live progress on the
  server tile. Files deleted locally are removed remotely via manifest
  diff.
- **Versioning** — every project is a real git repository (auto-initialized
  and auto-committed on deploy), commit UI and history with one-click
  rollback that never touches the working tree, automatic pre-deploy
  backups with rotation (only Wingman's own backups are ever rotated), and
  an optional build command with streamed output.
- **File browser** — navigate server files, create folders, delete files
  and folders.
- **Auto-updater** — the app checks GitHub releases and updates itself with
  one click.
- **Easy install** — Windows NSIS installer and a one-line Linux installer
  (`install.sh`, .deb on apt-based distros, AppImage elsewhere).
