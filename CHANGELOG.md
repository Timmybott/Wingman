# Changelog

All notable changes to Wingman are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Initial import** — linking a project to a server with an empty local
  folder now downloads the server's current files into it (and creates the
  first git checkpoint automatically).
- **Multi-device sync** — every deploy leaves a small state marker
  (`.wingman-state.json`) on the server. Other devices poll it and, when a
  newer deploy exists and their working tree is clean, automatically pull
  the server state into their local folder. Local uncommitted changes are
  never overwritten — you get a console note instead.
- **Update popup** — when a new release is available, a dialog appears
  right at startup with one-click "Install & restart".
- **Real logo** — a wing mark replaces the placeholder "W", identical in
  the header and the app icons.

### Changed

- Panel responses with `null` resource limits (seen on real panels) are
  handled everywhere.
- API keys: if the OS keychain is unavailable (e.g. Linux without a Secret
  Service), the key now falls back to an obfuscated file in the config
  directory instead of failing — see the README's security section.

### Fixed

- Backup limit handling when the panel reports no backup limit.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-19

First feature-complete version — everything from the v1 specification.

### Added

- **Panel connection & dashboard** — connect a Pterodactyl panel with a
  client API key (stored in the OS keychain, never in plain text) and see
  all servers as tiles with live status, CPU and RAM.
- **Live servers** — power actions (start/stop/restart, two-step kill),
  streamed console with command input, live stats over the Wings websocket
  with automatic token refresh and reconnect.
- **One-click deploys** — link a local project folder to a server and ship
  it: zip → upload via the panel's signed URL → extract, with
  `.deployignore` (gitignore syntax), configurable target directory,
  post-deploy restart or desktop notification, and live progress on the
  server tile. Files deleted locally are removed remotely via manifest
  diff.
- **Versioning** — every project is a real git repository (auto-initialized
  and auto-committed on deploy), commit UI and history with one-click
  rollback that never touches the working tree, automatic pre-deploy
  backups with rotation (only Wingman's own backups are ever rotated), and
  an optional build command with streamed output.
- **File browser** — navigate server files, create folders, delete files
  and folders.
- **Auto-updater** — the app checks GitHub releases and updates itself with
  one click.
- **Easy install** — Windows NSIS installer and a one-line Linux installer
  (`install.sh`, .deb on apt-based distros, AppImage elsewhere).
